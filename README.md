This document explains how to use the file flighy.py

Most important thing to set is the correct path for your file:

path = "/Documents/..../yourfile.csv "

Once you have set up the correct path, then you can run the whole
pipeline, or simply crun it by the 3 main sections and run it as a 
Jupyter notebook

# 1st section 
# Prepare historical delay features 
to #Create DataFrame



# 2nd section 
We create a dataframe because we use the library embedded for logistic 
regression. 

We then do feature engineering, that is, creating some features from
the original ones. This goes from Create Data Frame to Train/test split
  

# 3rd section

Here we calculate our logistic regression model and then calculate the
performance metrics for the classifier
